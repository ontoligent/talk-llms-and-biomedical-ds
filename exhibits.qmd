Quote 1

> How anybody can learn science from these books, I don’t know, because it’s not science.

Quote 2

> You can know the name of a bird in all languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. So let's look at the bird and what it's doing – that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."

"The Making of a Scientist," p. 14 - What Do You Care What Other People Think? (1988).

Quote 3

> Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.

From "The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman."
